The data returned is stored in a result-set. • The WHERE clause is used to filter records. • It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. • The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table. • The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table. • The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table. 2) What is MySQL database or Server?  MySQL is database management system (DBMS).  DBMS is a software used to store and manage data.  Database consists of a structured set of tables and each row of a table is a record. SQL  SQL stand for structure query language  SQL is a language which is used to operate your database.  SQL is the basic language used for all the databases.  SQL is used in the accessing, updating, and manipulation of data in a database. Adavatage: o cross platform- it can run any platform o it is used with multiple language (java, python, .net, php) o open source ","[Darshan Lohiya Interview Question] Disadvantages o Scalability in MySQL is a redundant task. o MySQL serves good for large databases mostly. o There are issues of the instability of software. 3) What is the default port for MySQL Server?  The default port for MySQL Server is 3306.  Another standard default port is 1433 in TCP/IP for SQL Server. 4) How to Test for NULL Values? • It is not possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>. • We will have to use the IS NULL & IS NOT NULL operators instead 5) What Can SQL do?  SQL can execute queries against a database  SQL can retrieve data from a database  SQL can insert records in a database  SQL can update records in a database  SQL can delete records from a database  SQL can create new databases  SQL can create new tables in a database  SQL can create stored procedures in a database 6) What is difference between SQL and MySQL?  SQL is a query language, whereas MySQL is a relational database that uses SQL to query a database.  You can use SQL to access, update, and manipulate the data stored in a database. However, MySQL is a database that stores the existing data in a database in an organized manner. 7) What is Normalization?  Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. This includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency • Join:- A join clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. • Inner join:- The inner join  keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables. • Left join:- The Left join  keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match. • Right join:- The Right join  keyword returns all records from the right ","[Darshan Lohiya Interview Question] table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match. • Full outer join:- The Full outer join keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records. • Self-join:- A self-join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself. • Join and subquery:- both are used to combine data from difference table into a single table 8) What is a Query?  A query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables.  A database query can be either a select query or an action query. 9) Difference between union and join Union Join Union is combination of rows Marge the column Not be necessary to have same column name. but no. of column and database column should be same Combine the rows from two or more tables base on a related common column between them Select city from table1 union Select city from table2 Select a.city, b.name from table1 a join table2 b on a.id=b.custId 10) Difference Between Delete and truncate? Key Delete Truncate Basic It is used to delete specific data It is used to delete the entire data of the table Where clause We can use with where clause It can’t be used with where clause Locking It locks the table now before deleting the row It locks the entire table Rollback We can rollback the changes We can’t rollback the changes performance It is slower than truncate It faster than delete ","[Darshan Lohiya Interview Question] 11) What is persist method?  The persist operation must be used only for new entities.  From JPA perspective, an entity is new when it has never been associated with a database row, meaning that there is no table record in the database to match the entity in question.  The persist method is intended for adding a new entity instance to the persistence context, i.e. transitioning an instance from transient to persistent state.  We usually call it when we want to add a record to the database (persist an entity instance) 12) What is cursor in sql database?  A database cursor is an identifier associated with a group of rows. It is, in a sense, a pointer to the current row in a buffer.  You must use a cursor in the following cases: Statements that return more than one row of data from the database server: A SELECT statement requires a select cursor.  Cursor is a Temporary Memory or Temporary Work Station.  It is allocated by Database Server at the Time of Performing DML operations on Table by User. Cursors are used to store Database Tables.  There are 2 types of Cursors: Implicit Cursors, and Explicit Cursors.  Cursor:-A cursor in sql is temporary work areas created in system memory when sql statement is executed a cursor is set of the together with pointer that identifies a current row  FIRST is used to fetch only the first row from cursor table. LAST is used to fetch only last row from cursor table. NEXT is used to fetch data in forward direction from cursor table. PRIOR is used to fetch data in backward direction from cursor table. ABSOLUTE n is used to fetch the exact n th row from cursor table. RELATIVE n is used to fetch the data in incremental way as well as detrimental way. Syntax : FETCH NEXT/FIRST/LAST/PRIOR/ABSOLUTE n/RELATIVE n FROM cursor_name 13) which is last line we write in before stop the cursor? • FETCH FIRST FROM s1 • FETCH LAST FROM s1 • FETCH NEXT FROM s1 • FETCH PRIOR FROM s1 • FETCH ABSOLUTE 7 FROM s1 • FETCH RELATIVE -2 FROM s1 ","[Darshan Lohiya Interview Question] 14) Difference between primary key Foreign key and unique key ? Primary key Foreign key Unique key Unique identifier for row of the table It is used to link two tables together Unique identifier for row of the table when primary key is not present Cannot null Foreign key column cannot access null value Can be null Only one primary key can be present in the table Table can have more than one foreign key Multiple unique key can be present in the table Selection using primary key creates clustered index Foreign key is not clustered index by default we can make clustered index Selection using primary key creates non- clustered index Clustered index:- Clustered indexes sort and store the data rows in the table or view based on their key values. 15) What is trigger?  A trigger is special type of stored procedure that automatically run when an event occur in the database server. Stored program which are automatically fixed/execute when same events occurred. Type of trigger 1. DML:- DML trigger can be categorized into two type (insert, update, delete )trigger • DML denotes Data Manipulation Language which includes commands such as SELECT, INSERT, etc. a. After trigger: -fires after the triggering action b. Instead of trigger: - fired instated of fired triggering action 2. DDL: - (create, alter, drop) • DDL is the abbreviation for Data Definition Language dealing with database schemas, as well as the description of how data resides in the database. An example of this is the CREATE TABLE command. 3. Login trigger: - Database Features of NoSQL • NoSQL Databases can have a common set of features such as: • Non-relational data model. • Runs well on clusters. • Mostly open-source. • Built for the new generation Web applications. ","[Darshan Lohiya Interview Question] • Is schema-less 16) Difference between RDBMS vs NoSQL RDBMS NoSQL 1. Data is stored in a relational model, with rows and columns. 2. A row contains information about an item while columns contain specific information, such as ‘Model’, ‘Date of Manufacture’, ‘Color’. 3. Follows fixed schema. Meaning, the columns are defined and locked before data entry. In addition, each row contains data for each column. 4. Supports vertical scaling. Scaling an RDBMS across multiple servers is a challenging and time- consuming process. 5. Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation & Durability(ACID) Compliant 1. Data is stored in a host of different databases, with different data storage models. 2. Follows dynamic schemas. Meaning, you can add columns anytime. 3. Supports horizontal scaling. You can scale across multiple servers. Multiple servers are cheap commodity hardware or cloud instances, which make scaling cost-effective compared to vertical scaling. 4. Not ACID Compliant. 17) Logging in spring boot?  In Java, Logging is an API that provides the ability to trace out the errors of the applications. When an application generates the logging call, the Logger records the event in the LogRecord. After that, it sends to the corresponding handlers or appenders. Before sending it to the console or file, the appenders format that log record by using the formatter or layouts  List of Java Keywords  A list of Java keywords or reserved words is given below: 1. abstract: Java abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.

A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank. This value is different than a zero value or a field that contains spaces. 30) SQL Composite Key  A composite key is a combination of two or more columns in a table that can be used to uniquely identify each row in the table when the columns are combined uniqueness is guaranteed, but when it taken individually it does not guarantee uniqueness.  Sometimes more than one attributes are needed to uniquely identify an entity.  A primary key that is made by the combination of more than one attribute is known as a composite key.  Composite key is a key which is the combination of more than one field or column of a given table. It may be a candidate key or primary key. 31) What are Aggregate and Scalar functions?  An aggregate function performs operations on a collection of values to return a single scalar value.  Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses of the SELECT statement.  Following are the widely used SQL aggregate functions: • AVG() - Calculates the mean of a collection of values. • COUNT() - Counts the total number of records in a specific table or view. • MIN() - Calculates the minimum of a collection of values. • MAX() - Calculates the maximum of a collection of values. • SUM() - Calculates the sum of a collection of values. • FIRST() - Fetches the first element in a collection of values. • LAST() - Fetches the last element in a collection of values. ➢ Note: All aggregate functions described above ignore NULL values except for the COUNT function. ","[Darshan Lohiya Interview Question]  A scalar function returns a single value based on the input value.  Following are the widely used SQL scalar functions: • LEN() - Calculates the total length of the given field (column). • UCASE() - Converts a collection of string values to uppercase characters. • LCASE() - Converts a collection of string values to lowercase characters. • MID() - Extracts substrings from a collection of string values in a table. • CONCAT() - Concatenates two or more strings. • RAND() - Generates a random collection of numbers of a given length. • ROUND() - Calculates the round-off integer value for a numeric field (or decimal point values). • NOW() - Returns the current date & time. • FORMAT() - Sets the format to display a collection of values. 32) Second Highest Salary in MySQL and SQL Server  Show databases;  Desc employee;  Insert employee values(1,’A’,5600.1); ","[Darshan Lohiya Interview Question]  Select * from employee;  SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employee);  Select Max(salary) as salary from employee;  Select MIN(salary) as salary from employee;  SELECT * FROM `employee` ORDER BY `salary` DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2; ","[Darshan Lohiya Interview Question] A.
